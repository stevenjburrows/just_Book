# Just Book

To create a Mobile app that a restaurant can use to take bookings for their tables and also store a regular customers details including any notes like allergies they have.

They can then find this customer and quickly add them to a booking to help speed things up and also allow the restaurant to prepare for any allergoes that they have.

## Technology used

The frontend is written in React Native using JavaScript with Expo and the backend is in Jave with Spring Boot
The database is Using MongoDB but looking back I would have used a SQL database
